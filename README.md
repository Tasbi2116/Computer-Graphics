# **Computer Graphics (CSE-4104) - Laboratory Work**  

## **Course Overview**  
This repository contains lab work for the course **CSE-4104: Computer Graphics Laboratory**. It includes various practical implementations of **computer graphics concepts**, such as **line drawing algorithms, transformations, 3D graphics, and more**.  

Each lab work is implemented using **Python** with libraries like **Matplotlib, NumPy, and OpenGL** (as needed). More details will be added as new lab exercises are completed.

## **Lab Work 1: Random Line Generator**  

### **Overview**  
This program generates **N random straight lines**, calculates their **slopes** and **angles** with the x-axis, and visualizes them using **Matplotlib**.  

### **Features**  
âœ” Random generation of **N lines** with unique start and end points  
âœ” Computation of **slope** and **angle** for each line  
âœ” Visualization with **color-coded plots**  
âœ” **Coordinate labels** for all key points  

### **Installation**  
To run this script, install the required libraries:  
```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
```

### **Usage**  
1. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python line.py
   ```
2. Enter the number of lines to generate.  
3. The script prints details of each line and displays a **graph** with plotted lines.  

### **Example Output**  
```
Enter the number of lines to draw: 3  

Line 1:  
  Start Point: (2,4)  
  End Point: (7,9)  
  Slope: 1.00  
  Angle with positive x-axis: 45.00Â°  
```
**Graph Output:**  
A plot with **3 randomly generated lines**, each labeled with its coordinates.

## **Lab Work 2: Circle Drawing**  

### **Overview**  
This program generates **N random circles**, computes their **center points and radii**, and visualizes them using **Matplotlib**.  

### **Features**  
âœ” Random generation of **N circles** with unique centers and radii  
âœ” Computation and visualization of each circle's **boundary points**  
âœ” Marks the **center point** and points at **45-degree intervals**  
âœ” Displays **coordinate labels** for key points  

### **Installation**  
To run this script, install the required libraries:  
```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
```

### **Usage**  
1. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python Circle.py
   ```
2. Enter the number of circles to generate.  
3. The script prints details of each circle and displays a **graph** with the plotted circles.  

### **Example Output**  
```
Enter the number of circles to draw: 2  

Circle 1:  
  Center: (4,6)  
  Radius: 5  
```
**Graph Output:**  
A plot with **2 randomly generated circles**, each labeled with its **center and 45-degree interval points**.
